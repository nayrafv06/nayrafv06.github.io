  <h2>-My Story-</h2>

  <p>My name is Nayra Flores Valdivia, I was born in Mexico City January 13, 2006. While growing up, my mom (Nayra Valdivia Herrera) decided to stop working as a teacher instructing Spanish, Math, Biology, and Chemistry in order to raise me and my older sister (Diana Flores Valdivia). My dad (Luis Flores Bonilla) worked in a bank (BBVA Bancomer) designing and programming computer systems. I grew up a part of the low Middle-Income class. With the attention and help of my mother I grew up to be top of my class getting the priviledge of carrying the Mexican flag more often than my classmates every Monday morning during our weekly flag bearing ceremony. I would also win the gold medal awards for my classes at the end of the year. Growing up I was always told the importance of education over everything else, education was the way to grow and reach my dreams of being part of a team building rockets, to ultimately one day go to space. Every day after school, my mom would pick me and my sister up and we would walk home together, always running ahead of my mom and playing. Imaginings that we were on a secret mission or in a distant planet as researchers; being the younger one I was always the assistant to my older sister, while it bothered me I knew it was just a game and in reality I could achieve the same things my sister could if not more. My mom would always yell at us to not run ahead of her and even though we never really understood why at that age, we knew that what mom says goes. In 2016 my dad lost his job due to incoming workers from Spain taking over those job positions; while devastated about losing his job, my dad decided to not look for a new job in a different bank and to instead leave everything behind in order to give me and my sister better resources to fight for a better future. Leaving Mexico was hard but I was still young and I was able to adapt fast by telling myself that it would just be another adverture, like the ones that me and my sister would go on basically every single day. I was not expecting much change, afterall I still had my parents and my sister with me. Coming to the US my dad started looking for a new job, something to do with coding or something where he could use his degree in computer science. After many months of job hunting I could see my dad's hopes diminish every single day, and as my mom started working as a housekeeper to have a source of income my dad gave up on finding a job in CS and instead went on to work as a houseman. My parents were no longer home during the weekday or weekends like they used to and being in school I struggled a lot making friends. It was hard for me to communicate with people so I would sit by myself during recess and lunch unitl I met someone that could speak with me. My first friend here and she could understand Spanish so we became really close very fast. I joined Rice Elementary School for the last three months of fourth grade. During the summer me and my sister dedicated ourselves to learning english, I would watch TV shows in English, listen to music in English and even read bedtime stories in English because they were the easiest thing I could read. Coming into fifth grade I was placed in extra classes with two new kids where they would teach us English and coming back I was able to undertand much more so after a couple months I became proficient enough to leave those classes. I had made so many new friends and I was no longer alone but it only lasted for a while until my first friend that I had made back in fourth grade started spreading rumors about me. Everyone would steer clear of me and would stop talking to me. During that time I decided to take to basketball during my breaks and basketball became my new best friend, I would imagine myself joining the NBA as the first woman in the leage and showing everyone that I belonged there. The next couple of months all of the rumors started to die down and people started talking to me again, altough I no longer trusted them I still wanted to feel like I belonged so I would talk to them but kept playing basketball in the meantime. I promoted from sixth grade and I went on to Middle School. and then something else changed in my first year of Middle School. I was placed in the third level of the Spanish Speakers class along with a friend. She was really nice and we would help each other with homework and talk every morning. I soon noticed that my feelings for her were changing into something more and from there I started my journey in learning more about my sexuality. It was a lonng time and really hard but the pandemic came. While a lot of people struggled through the pandemic, I was happy; it hurt to see people die every day but I was with my family, all of my family every singe day. For the longest time I was finally able to spend time with them and during that time me and my sister became extremely close. When I went into my first year of High School during the pandemic, my sister was a Senior so I would read all of her essays and stay up with her the whole night working nonstop. This was her chance to finally reach a milestone towards her dreams and I wanted to do anything I could to help her so she could make it big. During college acceptance rollouts she was constantly anxieous and then it came. She go into Cornell University and we all cheered for her it was such a happy moment and I was excited to see what would become of her. Going into my Sophomore year she left home to keep her studies going and everything was lonely again but this time I truly was alone, before she went to college every day after school at least she was here at home but now, now there really was no one home. It hurt and I was really sad for a long time, the sudden change affected my grades and mental health. I had to adapt to so many thing in the past couple of years and it was constant there really never was a year where something could stay the same. Immigrating, learning English, losing my friends, getting them back, not being able to trust people, questioning my sexuality, and now my sister leaving. My junior year was not the best either, I was still trying to figure out the biggest questions of my life and knowing that there would probably be more in the future was constantly causing me anxiety. My second smester I figured that if I didn't figure out some things soon it would keep weighing me down. I sat down with my thoughts and trying to understand them I came to some counclusions that helped me ease my anxiety. I can not control the future, I can only learn from what is happening and keep trying my best to move forward. I figured out that I did in fact feel attracted to women but I could also not deny that I had feelings for men in the past and after a lot of thinking I realized that I am bisexual, I could not tell my parents but I decided to not beat myself about it, when the time comes to tell them I can only accept that they will not fully understand me or accept me and that is fine because I accept myself. And the last thing that I was able to figure out is that it is hard to trust people again after they've hurt you, but hanging on to what happened is only going to hurt me more; while I was trying to figure out my feelings I cried to the Kali Uchis Red Moon in Venus album. I was finally able to let go of what other people had done to me and make peace with everything that had happened until now and it was then that I understood what Kali meant by holding on to a hot coal with the intention of throwing it at someone. I was able to accept this and started the process of healing from this. Currently in my senior year there are a lot of things that I am trying to figure out and still working in trusting people again I can finally have some peace of mind. I trust myself and I feel happy with myself, I see my value and the path towards my goals and my overall sense of belonging has become clearer. I believe that I can make change and that I am strong. I started Minorities in Higher Education, and became officer of the First Gen and Engineering clubs knowing that I could start the change in my school and open up the opportunities for my community and for myself.  </p>
