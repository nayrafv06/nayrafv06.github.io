            Being a part of the San Ysidro Teen Clinic as a Peer Health Advocate (PHA) we educate our community by doing
            community outreach, we host an open house once a year to inform community members of our services and give
            some sexual health information<br><br>


            During my internship I learned about sexual health, mental health, and health disparities within my
            community. I was able to get a certification in QPR, I learned about the different ways that I can help my
            community and I was able to teach other people about what they can do to stay safe.<br><br>


            During my second year on this internship I became a mentor and helped other PHAs understand topics while
            also helping organize community events. I led ice breakers and shared my experience with other people so
            that they would also be interested in becoming a PHA.<br>

            <p>In this program we created an autonomous vehicle using donkey sim for behavior cloning. We also trained the
            car with gnss coordinates and used a vesc to set up the direction of the motors and the way the car would
            move. <br><br>


            During the duration of the program I learned about embedded linux, coding with python, how to set up
            electronics, human behavior cloning, and programming PID controllers for our robots to drive smoother
            paths.<br><br>


            I contributed to this project by using my CAD skills to create the base plate where all of the electronics
            would go, I created a model using a donkey sim with a combination of my driving as well as my teammates.
            Then I worked on sshing into our jetson nano to start training our car with our model. I was able to drive
            the car around and record its path in order to use waypoints which I then fixed with PID
            controllers.<br>

            <p>During the Upward Bound Summer Residential Program I took classes on math, english, science, language, and
            a senior seminar. I was able to take an introductory class for calculus, a chemistry course, I learned the
            basics of Arabic, and for my last year doing this program I took an introductory class to statistics.
            <br><br>


            During my first year in the program I learned about integrals, the basics of a new foreign language, and
            forensic chemistry where we study our fingerprints. My last year doing this program I was able to get an
            introduction on statistics, and I learned about the different college systems while getting time to work on
            my personal statement and a head start on my PIQs for the UC applications.<br>

            <p>During my time on the summer sweetwater cohort we were able to get information on the school systems, and

            they taught me how to build a college list and choose the different colleges that I should apply to based on
            help offered for me as well as resources available to first generation students. <br>


            During the duration of the summer portion of this program I learned how to cope with stress and anxiety
            during the college application season, I also learned how to cope with imposter syndrome. I was given
            information on the different ways that I could approach college applications and I was able to spend most of
